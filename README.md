# Power-Circle
Plotting Sending and Receiving End Power Circle using MATLAB

This program plots a power circle diagram using given Values of Vs, Vr, A and B and plots the sending
end and receiving end graphs on a single figure.


## Way of giving input
All the Values are Comples, so the Sending End and Receiving End Volages should be pre adjusted
before giving any input to eliminate the error in the circle diagram location in the (a + bi) format. The
Values of the A and B parameter is to be given in the (a + bi) format
